                What is a JavaScript? JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, 
                alongside HTML and CSS.[11] As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, 
                often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
