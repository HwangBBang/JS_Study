The HyperText Markup Language or <span class = "html" >HTML</span> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

Web browsers receive <span class = "html" >HTML</span> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. <span class = "html" >HTML</span> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

<span class = "html" >HTML</span> elements are the building blocks of <span class = "html" >HTML</span> pages. With <span class = "html" >HTML</span> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <span class = "html" >HTML</span> provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
